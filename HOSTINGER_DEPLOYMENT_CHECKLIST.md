└── ecosystem.config.js
```

---

### 4. INSTALL DEPENDENCIES (SSH)

```bash
# SSH into server
ssh your_username@apexiumsschool.com
cd public_html

# Install only production dependencies
npm install --production

# Verify installation
npm list
```

---

### 5. START APPLICATION (Using PM2 Recommended)

**Option A: PM2 (Best Practice)**
```bash
npm install -g pm2
pm2 start app.js --name "school-crm"
pm2 startup
pm2 save
pm2 status
```

**Option B: Using Hostinger Node.js Manager**
- Go to cPanel → Node.js Manager
- Create new Node.js App
- Point to app.js file

---

### 6. CONFIGURE DOMAIN

In Hostinger cPanel:
- [ ] Domain points to public_html
- [ ] DNS configured correctly
- [ ] A Record → Your Server IP
- [ ] CNAME/MX records if needed

---

### 7. SSL CERTIFICATE

```bash
cPanel → AutoSSL  [Auto Install - Usually works]
OR
cPanel → Let's Encrypt SSL → Install
```

---

### 8. MIGRATE DATABASE (if you have existing data)

```bash
# Export from local:
mysqldump -u root -p school_system > backup.sql

# Import to Hostinger via phpMyAdmin:
# cPanel → phpMyAdmin → school_system → Import → backup.sql
```

---

## ✅ VERIFICATION

### Test Your Application:

```bash
# SSH into server and test
curl https://apexiumsschool.com
pm2 logs school-crm

# Check in browser:
