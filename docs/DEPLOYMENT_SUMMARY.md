# Deployment Ready - Summary

## Completed updates

### 1) Configuration files
- `vercel.json` to deploy frontend static files correctly
- `.vercelignore` to exclude backend/server files from Vercel builds
- `render.yaml` for backend and database deployment on Render
- `.gitignore` to exclude local/private files like `node_modules` and `.env`

### 2) Runtime configuration
- Frontend code uses environment-aware backend URL selection
- API requests and socket endpoints point to the proper backend in production

### 3) Documentation
- Deployment instructions and quick-start materials were added and standardized in English

---

## Recommended deployment flow

1. Push project to GitHub
2. Deploy backend on Render
3. Copy backend URL
4. Set frontend environment/API URL
5. Deploy frontend on Vercel
6. Run end-to-end tests on live URLs

---

## Quick checklist

- [ ] Repository pushed to GitHub
- [ ] Backend deployed on Render
- [ ] Backend URL confirmed
- [ ] Frontend configured with backend URL
- [ ] Frontend deployed on Vercel
- [ ] Login, CRUD, and real-time features tested
- [ ] Database connectivity verified

---

## Expected results

### Frontend URL
```
https://your-project.vercel.app
```

### Backend URL
```
https://your-backend.onrender.com
```

## Important notes

### Render free tier
- Service may sleep after inactivity
- First request after sleep can be slower

### Vercel
- Fast static hosting
- Automatic deployments on push

### Database
- Review current Render MySQL pricing and limits

---

## Troubleshooting

### Frontend cannot reach backend
- Verify backend URL in frontend config
- Verify CORS settings
- Verify backend is running

### Database errors
- Verify DB credentials and env vars
- Verify database service status

### Deployment errors
- Check Render logs
- Check Vercel deployment logs

---

## Next steps
- Add custom domain
- Configure monitoring/alerts
- Set backup policy
- Share access with users/admins
