## 🆘 Troubleshooting During Deployment

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check logs:**
   ```bash
   ssh user@domain.com
   tail -100 /home/username/my_school_app/logs/app.log
   tail -100 /home/username/my_school_app/logs/error.log
   ```

2. **Verify environment variables are set**
   - Check each variable in cPanel Node app dashboard

3. **Test database connection:**
   ```bash
   mysql -h localhost -u your_db_user -p your_database
   ```

4. **Review documentation:**
   - [CPANEL_DEPLOYMENT_COMPLETE.md](docs/CPANEL_DEPLOYMENT_COMPLETE.md#troubleshooting)
   - [PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md](docs/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md)

5. **Common fixes:**
   - Restart the Node.js app in cPanel
   - Run npm install again
   - Check database credentials
   - Verify SMTP settings
   - Clear browser cache
